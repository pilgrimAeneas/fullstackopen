The Web, Its Standards, and Browsers
- Clients and Servers
- DNS, TCP/IP, and HTTP
- Packets, Requests, and Responses
- URL Components: Protocol, Domain, Subdomain, and Path

Clients and Servers
- Computers connected to the internet are clients or servers
- Clients are the typical user's computer that sends requests to the server.
    - Also references the web-accessing software on these computers.
- Servers store websites, webpages, or apps. And respond to requests from clients.
    - Usually respond with the relevant code for the browser to evaluate and render.

High-level Workings of the Web
- Internet Connection
    - Send and receive data on the internet - the pipes - which connects computers.
- Internet and Transmission Control Protocols (TCP/IP)
    - Define how data is routed and transmitted across the internet.
    - IP does the routing, and TCP controls the transmission.
    - 
- TODO: PACKETS
- Domain Name System (DNS)
    - The address book of websites, mapping web address to IP address.
    - The client needs the server IP address from the DNS, for routing.
- HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
    - HTTP is an application layer protocol.
    - It defines interaction (request, response) between client and server.
- TODO: REQUESTS and RESPONSES

Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
- TODO: Full URL
- TODO: Protocol
- TODO: Domain
- TODO: Subdomain
- TODO: Path

Simple Demo
1. Type a web address or a full URL in the address bar and hit return.
2. The browser checks with DNS for the IP address of the server hosting the website.
3. The browser sends an HTTP GET request to the server for a copy of the website.
    - This message and all other data is transmitted across your internet connection under TCP/IP.
    - The way data under TCP/IP is transmitted is as data packets.
4. If the request is approved:
    - The server sends back a response with HTTP code "200 OK".
    - The response carries also the main index HTML, which might cause more GET requests.
5. The browser revaluates and renders all the code files as it receives them.
